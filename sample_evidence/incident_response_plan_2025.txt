1. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
=================================================================

This Incident Response Plan establishes the procedures and protocols 
for detecting, responding to, and recovering from information security 
incidents. This plan applies to all information systems and data owned 
or operated by the organization.

Objectives:
- Minimize impact of security incidents on business operations
- Preserve evidence for forensic analysis and legal proceedings
- Ensure timely communication with stakeholders
- Comply with regulatory reporting requirements
- Continuously improve security posture through lessons learned

=================================================================
2. INCIDENT DETECTION AND IDENTIFICATION
=================================================================

2.1 Monitoring Systems
- 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring
- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system
- Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools
- Log correlation and analysis platform

2.2 Detection Sources
- Automated security alerts
- User reports via security@company.com
- Third-party security notifications
- Vulnerability scanning results
- Threat intelligence feeds

2.3 Initial Triage
- Review alert details and context
- Verify whether alert is true positive
- Assess potential scope and impact
- Escalate to incident response team if confirmed

=================================================================
3. INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION
=================================================================

3.1 Severity Levels

CRITICAL (P1)
- Definition: Widespread system compromise, data breach, or business-critical system unavailability
- Response Time: Immediate (< 15 minutes)
- Example: Ransomware outbreak, active data exfiltration

HIGH (P2)
- Definition: Significant security event affecting multiple systems or sensitive data
- Response Time: Within 1 hour
- Example: Malware infection, unauthorized access to sensitive systems

MEDIUM (P3)
- Definition: Security event with limited scope or impact
- Response Time: Within 4 hours
- Example: Failed login attempts, phishing email received

LOW (P4)
- Definition: Minor security event requiring investigation but no immediate threat
- Response Time: Within 24 hours
- Example: Policy violation, suspicious but non-malicious activity

3.2 Incident Categories
- Malware/Ransomware
- Phishing/Social Engineering
- Unauthorized Access
- Data Breach/Exfiltration
- Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS)
- Insider Threat
- Physical Security Breach
- Third-Party/Supply Chain Incident

=================================================================
4. RESPONSE PROCEDURES
=================================================================

4.1 Immediate Actions (First 15 Minutes)
1. Confirm incident and assess severity
2. Notify Incident Response Team Lead
3. Begin incident log documentation
4. Implement immediate containment if possible
5. Preserve evidence

4.2 Containment Strategies

SHORT-TERM CONTAINMENT
- Isolate affected systems from network
- Block malicious IP addresses at firewall
- Disable compromised user accounts
- Take snapshots/images of affected systems

LONG-TERM CONTAINMENT

- Implement compensating controls
- Update firewall rules
- Enhance monitoring for similar threats

4.3 Eradication Steps
- Remove malware and malicious artifacts
- Close unauthorized access paths
- Patch vulnerabilities
- Rebuild compromised systems from clean backups
- Reset credentials for affected accounts

4.4 Recovery Process
- Restore systems from verified clean backups
- Gradually return systems to production
- Enhanced monitoring during recovery period
- Verify system integrity and functionality
- Document configuration changes

4.5 Evidence Preservation
- Create forensic images of affected systems
- Preserve logs (minimum 90 days)
- Document chain of custody
- Store evidence in secure, isolated environment
- Maintain detailed incident timeline
